      Pride and Accomplishment is a game about getting as much dopamine, achievements, and other stuff, as you can.<br><br>
      The fist thing you can do is buy generators.<br>
      <h2>
        Generators
      </h2>
      These are the first things you buy in Pride and Accomplishment.<br>
      The costs start with 10 dopamine, and each generator bought multiplies production by 1.8, along with doubling the cost.<br>
      Their power can be increased via achievements.
      <h2>
        Achievements
      </h2>
      Achievements are basically what keep the game going past a certain point. Achievements are earned every order of magnitude of dopamine made.<br>
      They also multiply production by 1.01 for each one earned. Prestige can help continue earning them.
      <h2>
        Prestige
      </h2>
      Prestige is unlocked at e6 dopamine. When you prestige, everything is reset except for the achievement boost.<br>
      After prestiging, you can regain achievements and continue increasing the boost.<br>
      The boost that remains is due to banked achievements, which will be used to buy upgrades in a future update.
